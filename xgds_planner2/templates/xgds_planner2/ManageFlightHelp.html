<h3>Manage Schedule Help</h3>
<p>
A "{{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}" is the execution of one or more plans at a given time on a given vehicle.  For example, you may have a series of related plans that you intend to execute in a sequence on a certain day.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Schedule Plans:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="{% url 'planner2_index' %}" target="_blank">List Plans</a> page.</li>
<li>Check the box to the left of the plan you want to schedule.</li>
<li>Click the Schedule Selected blue button on the upper right; this dialog will pop up:<br/>
<img src="{{STATIC_URL}}xgds_planner2/images/SchedulePlan.png"</li>
<li>Click the box to the right of the When label and select the date AND time (24 hour clock) when you intend to run the plan.  Note it does not have to be exact.</li>
<li>Click the Schedule button</li>
<li>You will notice that there is now a time in the Scheduled column on the list plans page.</li>
<li>You can schedule the same plan to be run at different times.</li>
</ol>
Notes: behind the scenes, this created a {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}} for you if there was not already a {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}} for that day.
</p> 
<p>
<h2>Manage Schedule:</h2>
In order to start up the video infrastructure on xGDS, you need to start (and stop) {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}s.  In order to have accurate times in Playbook you need to start (and stop) plans.
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="{% url 'planner2_manage' %}" target="_blank">Manage Schedule</a> page.</li>
<li>You will see a list of the {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}s, indented under the {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}s are the plans scheduled for those {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}s.</li>
<li>If you are just managing {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}s for today, it's nice to check the "Today Only" box on the upper left.</li>
<li>To start a {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}, click the start link next to the {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}} you want to start.  Active {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}s will be listed in green.  You should do this when the rover is up and running and there is a track in xGDS.</li>
<li>To start a plan, click the start link next to the plan you want to start.  Active plans will be listed in green.</li>
<li>When the plan is done (aborted or completed) click the stop button next to the plan.  The plan will no longer be green and it will show the stop time.</li>
<li>When the {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}} is done, click the stop button next to the {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}.  The {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}} will no longer be green and it will show the stop time.</li>
<li>If you accidentally added plans you don't intend to run to the {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}, you can delete them.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Multiple {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}s on one day:</h2>
There may be a time when we have multiple executions on one day, i.e. the rover powers down midday, you move to a different site, or take a lunch break.  There is no limit to how many {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}s you can set up for one day.  In this case, you will have to manually create all subsequent {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}s for a day.
Our naming convention for {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}s is DATELETTER_VEHICLE, for example 20140912A_KRex2.
<h2>To create a {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}} manually:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Manage Schedule page https://mvp.xgds.org/xgds_planner2/manage/</li>
<li>Click the blue Create {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}s button on the upper right.</li>
<li>Choose the date of the {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}} you want to create.</li>
<li>Choose the prefix letter of the {{settings.XDGS_PLANNER2_FLIGHT_MONIKER}}; most likely it will be B or higher.  Please use uppercase.</li>
<li>Make sure the vehicle(s) you want are checked.</li>
<li>Click Create.</li>
</ol>
