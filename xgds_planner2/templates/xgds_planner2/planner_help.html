<h2>Browser Help</h2>

<p>The XGDS Planner has specific requirements for end-users in order to function properly.</p>

<p>The planner is known to work in Google Chrome. Although older versions Chrome may work, the latest versions are recommended. The planner may also work in other browsers, but testing is done in Chrome, so functionality may be broken in browsers other than Chrome.</p>

<p>Most of the functionality in the planner is dependent on Javascript. Javascript must be enabled in order for the planner to work properly.</p>

<p>The planner has a Google Earth component, which can only function if the Google Earth Plugin is installed and working. Though certain plan information can be accessed without the plugin, adding and removing stations, as well as a visual representation of the plan isn't possible.</p>
